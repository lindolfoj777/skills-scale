# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

This README provides an introduction to how OctoAcme project management works and serves as a guide to all process documents. It aligns with the program's goal to centralize, standardize, and surface process know-how for ease of onboarding and continuous improvement.

## Project Management Summary

The OctoAcme approach is customer-focused, iterative, and evidence-driven. Core practices include:

- Clear project initiation with a documented one-pager and stakeholder engagement
- Detailed planning — backlog, estimates, risks, and milestone mapping
- Execution and QA tracked in GitHub with PR, test, and release conventions
- Automated deployments with standardized checklists for releases and incident response
- Retrospectives and continuous improvement after each sprint or milestone
- Clear roles: Project Managers, Product Managers, Developers, Stakeholders
- Risks and communication handled transparently via dedicated processes
