# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. **Kickoff meeting** with stakeholders and delivery team
   - Review project one-pager and success metrics
   - Introduce team members and clarify roles
   - Establish communication channels and meeting cadence
   - See [Cross-Role Collaboration Matrix](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#cross-role-collaboration-matrix) for role interactions

2. **Create prioritized backlog** with acceptance criteria
   - Product Manager leads backlog creation with input from UX and Engineering
   - Use the Backlog Item Template (below) for consistency
   - Ensure each item has clear acceptance criteria

3. **Estimate scope** (T-shirt sizing or story points)
   - Developers provide estimates with input from QA on testing effort
   - Consider technical complexity, unknowns, and dependencies

4. **Define Definition of Done (DoD)**
   - Align with all roles on what "done" means
   - Include code review, testing, documentation requirements

5. **Identify dependencies and integration points**
   - Map cross-team dependencies early
   - Assign owners to manage each dependency
   - See [Risk & Dependency Management](#risk--dependency-management) below

6. **Create release plan and milestone map**
   - Work with Release Manager to plan deployment windows
   - Coordinate with Technical Writer for documentation timelines
   - Align with QA on testing cycles

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:
- Estimate:
- Owner:
- Related docs/links:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length (typically 1-2 weeks)
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected (account for time off, meetings, support)
- Use the [Sprint Planning Template](octoacme-templates-and-checklists.md#sprint-planning-template) for structured planning sessions

### Planning Meeting Attendees
- **Required:** Product Manager, Project Manager, Developers, QA
- **Optional:** UX Designer (for design-heavy sprints), Technical Writer (for doc-heavy sprints)
- **As Needed:** Release Manager (for release planning sprints)

### Sprint Planning Outputs
- Committed sprint backlog with owner assignments
- Sprint goal statement (one sentence)
- Identified risks and mitigation plans
- Updated Definition of Done (if needed)

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
